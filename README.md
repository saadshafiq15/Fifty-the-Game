# Fifty-the-Game
Fifty is a coding project that involves creating a digital version of the card game of the same name. 
In this project, I designed and implemented the game's mechanics..
To create the game, I had to have a solid understanding of programming concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented design. 
I also needed to be familiar with Java.
As I worked on the project, I had the opportunity to apply my coding skills to create a fully functional game that can be played by users on a computer.
Overall, the Fifty coding project was a great opportunity to for me show my programming skills and create a fun and engaging digital game that can be enjoyed by players around the world.
